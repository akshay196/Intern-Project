### 1. Overview
___
<p>In this project we have developed a machine learning module using Open Computer Vision which will be used to identify different jobs different jobs. Variety of machine learning approaches were examined to solve job and defect identification problem. Also we have developed a small module to identify visual defects in given job. This project was basically done for a manufacturing company.</p>

### 2. Working Environment
___
<p>Our project is completely open source. We have used open source operating system like Fedora and other open source tools and libraries like Spyder, OpenCV. We used Python 3.6 as our base language for developing source code.  The system will run on Raspberry Pi, which can be mounted at any required place. Suitable place for would be near to conveyer belt on which various kinds of jobs will be moving on. The Raspberry Pi would be connected to a camera which would be placed above the conveyer line.The video captured by camera would be feed to Raspberry Pi for processing, the result of Raspberry Pi will be display on screen and required further actions will be taken on.</p>
